        <p>Prayagraj (previously Allahabad) is a place that is steeped in Hindu mythology. It is believed <br>
             that Sangam (confluence of River Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati) is where Hindu deities Rama, <br>
              Sita and Laxmana crossed over the river. As per the legends, Prayagraj is also the place, where <br>
               the trio spent some days during their days in exile.

        <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/68253022/Chitrakoot.jpg?width=748&resize=4" alt="Chitrakoot">
        <p>Chitrakoot lies between the two Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, and is <br>
             home to some much-revered Hindu temples. If you wish to delve more into Hindu mythology, <br>
              this place is a must-visit. As believed, this is the site of Bharat  Milaap, where Ramayana’s Bharat <br>
               met Rama, and persuaded him to come back to Ayodhya, their kingdom after King Dashratha’s <br>
                demise.</p>

    <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/68253073/Dwarka.jpg?width=748&resize=4" alt="Dwarka">
    <p>One of the most ancient cities in the country, Dwarka is as mythical as it gets. It is also <br> 
        prominent as one of the Char Dhams, the four major pilgrimage sites for the Hindus. It is <br>
          believed to be the capital of Hindu deity Krishna, and its meaning translates to ‘Gateway to <br>
           Heaven’. It is also said that Krishna, with his godly powers, claimed 12 acres from the ocean to <br>
            build Dwarka.

<h2><span id="highlight"> <u> Dandkaranya</u></span></h2>
<img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/68253135/dandakaranya.jpg?width=748&resize=4" alt="Dandkarnya">
<p>Now in Chattisgarh, Dandkaranya is believed to be the forest where Ravana abducted Sita in <br>
    Hindu epic Ramayana. Hindus believe it to be a site of penance owing to its connection with <br>
    Ramayana. The area is spread over 92200 sq km, and includes parts of Andhra Pradesh, <br>
    Chattisgarh, Telangana and Odisha as well.

    <h2><span id="highlight"><u>Haridwar </u></span></h2>
    <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/68253169/Haridwar.jpg?width=748&resize=4" alt="Haridwar">
    <p>
        Haridwar, though quite touristy now, has its roots deep in Hindu mythology. Apart from the <br>
         fact that this is where River Ganga touches the plains for the first time, coming down from the <br>
          Himalayas, this city has stories, and many of them are unheard of. Other than the more <br>
           famous places, Haridwar is home to the Daksha Mahadeva Temple, which is believed to be <br>
            home to Sati, Shiva’s first wife. The evening aarti at the temple is a spectacle; not to be missed.</p>

    <h2><span id="highlight"><u> Devprayag </u></span></h2>
    <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/68253216/devprayaga.jpg?width=748&resize=4" alt="Devprayag">
    <p>Uttarakhand’s Devprayag is another major pilgrimage site for the followers of Hinduism. This is <br>
         where River Alaknanda meets Bhagirathi and comes to being as River Ganga. Those interested <br>
          in a more insightful time can head to the two libraries at Devprayag; both are home to some <br>
           very rare, ancient manuscripts, written primarily in Hindi and Garhwali. The place lies at some <br>
            70 km from Rishikesh and is quite well-connected via a national highway.

    <h2><span id="highlight"><u>Hampi </u></span></h2>
    <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/photo/68253245/Hampi.jpg?width=748&resize=4" alt="Hampi">
    <p>
        This one again has a connect with the epic of Ramayana. It is believed to have been Kishkindha, <br>
         the capital of monkey king Sugriva, as mentioned in the epic. Thus, for the believers, Hampi is <br>
          where the epic battle between Rama and Ravana was also planned. Other than the <br>
           mythological connect, Hampi is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site and has some of the most <br>
            stunning architectural marvels in the world.</p>

    <h2><span id="highlight"><u>Ayodhya</u></span></h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/haryana-history.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Unfortunately, this city is known for the bloodshed it has witnessed over the issue of <br>
         Ram- janmabhoomi. According to Ramayana, this city is the birthplace of Lord Rama. <br>
          According to the scripture, Ayodhya has once witnessed Ram-rajya. It was a face of an <br>
           ideal kingdom, which was free from misery. This city has been praised elaborately in the <br>
            Atharva Veda too, and has been the capital of the kings of the Surya Dynasty.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2><span id="highlight"><u>Puri</u></span></h2>
    <img src="https://s3.india.com/travel/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/puri.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Puri in Orissa which is known for the spectacular Konark Sun Temple is actually the <br>
         birthplace of Lord Vishwakarma, master craftsman himself and workmens deity. Sun <br>
          temple in Konark pays an ode to Lord Vishwakarma. This marvellous temple is a must <br>
           visit destination for all as it is the epitome of Indian craftsmanship.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2><span id="highlight"><u>Amarnath</u></span></h2>
    <img src="https://www.holidify.com/images/bgImages/AMARNATH.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Amarnath is one of the most important pilgrimage in India for the worshippers of Lord Shiva. <br>
        It is believed that Lord Shiva left Nandi, the bull, at Pahalgam (Bail Gaon). At <br>
         Chandanwari, he released the Moon from his hair (Jata). On the banks of Lake <br>
          Sheshnag, he released his snakes. ... Then, finally, Lord Shiva entered the Holy <br>
           Amarnath Cave along with Mata Parvati.</p>
