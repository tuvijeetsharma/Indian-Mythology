 <br>
    <div class="mythology">
        <p class="about">Jagannath ( Odia: ଜଗନ୍ନାଥ, ISO: Jagannātha; lit. ''lord of the universe'', ) is a deity worshipped in regional traditions of Hinduism in India and Bangladesh. Jagannath is considered a form of Vishnu. He is part of a triad along with his brother Balabhadra and sister Subhadra.They stay there for a few days, after which they are returned to the main temple. Coinciding with the Ratha Yatra festival at Puri, similar processions are organized at Jagannath temples throughout the world. During the festive public procession of Jagannath in Puri lakhs of devotees visit Puri to see Lord Jagganath in chariot.</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p id="about">The icon of Jagannath is a carved and decorated wooden stump with large round eyes and a symmetric face, and the icon has a conspicuous absence of hands or legs. The worship procedures, sacraments and rituals associated with Jagannath are syncretic, and include rites that are uncommon in Hinduism. The origin and evolution of Jagannath worship is unclear. Some scholars interpret hymn 10.155.3 of the Rigveda as a possible origin, but others disagree and state that it is a syncretic deity with tribal roots. His name does not appear in the traditional Dashavatara (ten avatars) of Vishnu, though in certain Odia literature, Jagannath has been treated as the ninth avatar, as a substitute for or the equivalent of the Shakyamuni Buddha.\
            The annual festival called the Ratha yatra celebrated in June or July every year in eastern states of India is dedicated to Jagannath. His image, along with the other two associated deities, is ceremoniously brought out of the sacrosanctum (Garbhagriha) of his chief temple in Jagannath Puri (Oriya: Bada Deula).

   <br><br><br>
   <p>Nandighosa
       Lord Jagannath's chariot, named Nandighosa, has a height of 44 ft and two inches, along with 16 wheels each having a diameter of 6 feet. The chariot's colour is yellow and red, and the horses are white in colour and their names are Shankha, Balahaka, Suweta and Haridashwa.The chariot of Lord Balabhadra, named Taladhwaja, has a height of 43 feet and 3 inches and 14 wheels measuring six feet six inches in diameter. The chariot is green and red in colour, and the horses are black. The names of the horses are Tribra, Ghora, Dirghasharma and Swornanava.
       The chariot of Goddess Subhadra is named Debadalana and has a height of 43 feet and three inches. The chariot has 12 wheels, measuring six feet eight inches in diameter and is black and red in colour. The horses’ colour for Devi Subhadra’s chariot is red and their names are Rochika, Mochika, Jita and Aparajita.
       The wood used in its construction comes from two nearby forests Dashpalla and Ranapur. After the Rath Yatra, the chariots are dismantled and the wood is used in the kitchen of Jagannath Temple to cook Mahaprasad.
 The movement of chariot commences after the King of Puri sweeps all the chariots with a broom made out of gold, using fragrant water. Apart from different names for the chariot, the flags on top of each chariot as well as the ropes with which they are pulled also have a unique name.
