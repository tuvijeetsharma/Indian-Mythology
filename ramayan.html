    <h1>The Great Epic "RAMAYANA!!"</h1>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">The Ramayana is known as the Adi Kavya (the earliest narrative poem).</span> It contains 24,000 verses and is divided
        into seven books. The central theme of this epic is the con­flict between Rama, a representative of the Aryan
        civilization, and Ravana, a representative of the non-Aryan civilisation.
        <br><br>

        <br><br>
        
        


        <br><br>
        <span class="highlight">According to the story of the Ramayana, King Dasaratha ruled over Kosala (northern Oudha) with Ayodhya as his
        capital. He had three wives, Kaushalya, the chief queen, Sumitra and Kaikayi. He had four sons—Rama, (the eldest
        son born of Kaushalya), Lakshmana and Shatrughana (born of Sumitra) and Bharat (son of the youngest queen
        Kaikayi).</span>
<br><br>

       <br><br>
When Dashratha grew old, he wished Rama to succeed him to the throne, and therefore, appointed him Yuvraj.
<br><br>
<span class="highlight">This was quite distasteful to Kaikayi, the youngest queen, who wanted her son Bharat to succeed Dashrath.</span>
        Utilizing the two promises or vardans given by King Dashratha in the past, she demanded the exile of Rama for 14
        years, and throne for her son Bharat.
        <br><br>

<br><br>
        Rama as a dutiful son proceeded on exile with his wife and Lakshman, his brother who loved him most.<span class="highlight"> Bharat, who
        also loved Rama very much, also refused to accept the throne and followed him in jungles.</span> However, on persuasion
        of Rama he returned to Ayodhya and continued to rule in the name of Rama during the period of his exile.

            alt="">

        <br><br>
        <span class="highlight"> During the course of exile while Rama was living in the forest at Panchavati near Nasik, Ravana’s sister visited
        them and asked Laxman to marry her. Laxman not only refused to marry her but also insulted her. Ravana, the
        demon king, took revenge for the insult of his sister by abducting Sita to Lanka (Ceylon).</span>
<br><br>
<img src="https://www.deshabhimani.com/images/news/english/large/sita-rama-500532.jpg" alt="">
<br><br>
<span class="highlight">Rama and Laxman marched towards Lanka to rescue Sita. On the way Rama helped Sughriva to regain his lost kingdom
        from Bali.</span> As a token of gratitude for this favour Sughriva offered the services of Hanuman, his able army
        general.
        <br><br>

        <span class="highlight">  Ultimately as a result of the great battle between Rama and Ravana at Lanka, Ravana was defeated and killed.
        Sita was brought back. In the meanwhile the term of fourteen years of exile was over and Rama returned to
        Ayodhya and became the king.</span> He continued to rule for a long time.
<br><br>
        However, the troubles of Rama were not over and he was forced to send away Sita from his palace because her
        chastity was suspected by some of the subjects.<span class="highlight"> Sita ultimately found shelter in the ashrama of Valmiki and gave
        birth to Lava and Kusha.</span>
<br><br>

        <br><br>



        <span class="highlight">Rama discovered about the identity of these two sons only when he performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice and his
        horse was detained by these brave boys. These boys later on succeeded Rama.</span>

        <h2>Its not over yet(what point reading or watching a story and do not know the moral of it)</h2>
        <h3>1. The truth always prevails.</h3>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.mumbailive.com/images/media/images/images_1596620262103_ramayan.jpg?bg=36332e&crop=1200%2C900%2C0%2C0&fit=fill&h=768&height=900&w=1368&width=1200"
            alt="">
        <p>It is understandable to be disappointed in how people and governments all over the world are functioning today.<span class="highlight"> Even faced with insurmountable odds and a strong opponent like Ravana, Lord Rama stood by what is right and defeated the odds.</span> Perhaps, the most important life lesson to learn from the Ramayana is that truth always prevails and the victory of good over evil is inevitable – do not lose hope. </p>
        <br>
        <h3>2. It is not your position but your spirit of service that matters.</h3>
        <img class="img" src="https://www.thesacredconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Lord-Rama-controversy.jpg"
        alt="">
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">  Whether he was required to serve his people as a king or give his position up and venture into the forest, Lord Rama unequivocally stepped up to serve his people, his family, and what he believed in. Instead of getting stuck on positions or fame, the Ramayana teaches that the spirit of service is what sets you apart – do your bit where you are and with whatever resources you have.</span> A great real-life example of this is the altruistic work being done by actor Sonu Sood during the pandemic. From airlifting stranded children to helping migrants make their way home at his own cost, Sood’s spirit of service is not connected to any position or post but to his innate goodness.
        </p>
 <br>
        <h3>3. Value your support system. </h3>
        <img class="img" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tiBlZRsnbLY/U043jxqov_I/AAAAAAAAEH8/eO6EJo18Y8g/s1600/487177_302765076495195_206044061_n.jpg" alt="">
        <p>When Lord Rama was banished into exile, his brother Laxman chose to give up the luxuries of life as a prince and stand by his brother. Similarly, Bharat stayed back but did not accept the position of king, choosing to rule in Lord Ram’s stead as he waited for his brother to come home. The people that surround you are your biggest strength. This life was not meant to be lived alone. Seek help when you need it, and value the people in your life.<span class="highlight"> The untimely death by suicide of actor Sushant Singh Rajput is a critique of the flailing mental health conditions in India. Seek help when you need it. Like Lord Rama, you are not alone.</span> </p>
        <br>
        <h3>4. Plant seeds of faith. </h3>
        <img class="img" src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-7460b3eef2560f19e015ae86a21e5ce0" alt="">
        <p><span class="highlight">Ramayana teaches that a devotee has access to God wherever he/she is. Visiting places of worship is not practical or desirable during the pandemic. However, like Shabari whose devotion brings Lord Rama right to her doorstep, you do not need a temple to worship– all you need is a clear heart and faith.</span> Improving on a 93-year-old tradition, Mumbai’s Lalbaugcha Raja Ganeshotsav Mandal has decided to hold a blood and plasma donation camp to help COVID-19 patients instead of raising the traditional pandal for a grand Ganesh idol. With Mumbai’s increasing number of coronavirus cases in mind, this is a move that says that the way to please God is to extend help to your fellowmen. </p>
       <br>
        <h3>5. Unity in diversity is possible and necessary.  </h3>
        <img class="img" src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/5b/99/b4/5b99b4d18f33fbb9b1e72b6d405343b0.jpg"
            alt="">
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">When Lord Rama set out to defeat Ravana, he was not alone. Even though he was exiled, he had his people’s support. The gods stood with him, too. The famous Vanarasena led by Sugriva and Hanuman were by his side. This support and unity are what made it possible for Lord Ram to reach Lanka and defeat Ravana. In today’s world, it might seem impossible for people from different backgrounds to come together and help each other. With more cases of violence against Dalits and lynching of Indian Muslims coming to light, now is the time to stand with each other, irrespective of differences.</span> The Ramayana teaches us that not only is it possible, but it is also necessary to ensure victory over evil forces.
            Lord Ram is the epitome of kindness, compassion, and love. His wisdom and patience made it possible for him to follow his inner good without worrying about the loss of luxuries and kingship. There is much to learn from the personal character of Lord Ram as well as the many stories in the epic. Look deeper than face value to find the hidden truth of the Ramayana.
