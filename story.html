           <video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeSDxINeNE">Story</video>
           <p>
            The story begins when the blindness of Dhritarashtra, the elder of two princes, causes him to be passed over in favour of his brother Pandu as king on their father’s death. A curse prevents Pandu from fathering children, however, and his wife Kunti asks the gods to father children in Pandu’s name. As a result, the god Dharma fathers Yudhishtira, the Wind fathers Bhima, Indra fathers Arjuna, and the Ashvins (twins) father Nakula and Sahadeva (also twins; born to Pandu’s second wife, Madri). The enmity and jealousy that develops between the cousins forces the Pandavas to leave the kingdom when their father dies. During their exile the five jointly marry Draupadi (who is born out of a sacrificial fire and whom Arjuna wins by shooting an arrow through a row of targets) and meet their cousin Krishna, who remains their friend and companion thereafter. Although the Pandavas return to the kingdom, they are again exiled to the forest, this time for 12 years, when Yudhishthira loses everything in a game of dice with Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas.

            The feud culminates in a series of great battles on the field of Kurukshetra (north of Delhi, in Haryana state). All the Kauravas are annihilated, and, on the victorious side, only the five Pandava brothers and Krishna survive. Krishna dies when a hunter, who mistakes him for a deer, shoots him in his one vulnerable spot—his foot—and the five brothers, along with Draupadi and a dog who joins them (Dharma, Yudhisththira’s father, in disguise), set out for Indra’s heaven. One by one they fall on the way, and Yudhisthira alone reaches the gate of heaven. After further tests of his faithfulness and constancy, he is finally reunited with his brothers and Draupadi, as well as with his enemies, the Kauravas, to enjoy perpetual bliss.The central plot constitutes little more than one fifth of the total work. The remainder of the poem addresses a wide range of myths and legends, including the romance of Damayanti and her husband Nala (who gambles away his kingdom just as Yudhishthira gambles away his) and the legend of Savitri, whose devotion to her dead husband persuades Yama, the god of death, to restore him to life. The poem also contains descriptions of places of pilgrimages.Along with its basic plot and accounts of numerous myths, the Mahabharata reveals the evolution of Hinduism and its relations with other religions during its composition. The period during which the epic took shape was one of transition from Vedic sacrifice to sectarian Hinduism, as well as a time of interaction—sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile—with Buddhism and Jainism. Different sections of the poem express varying beliefs, often in creative tension. Some sections—such as the Narayaniya (a part of book 13), the Bhagavadgita (book 6), the Anugita (book 14), and the Harivamsha—are important sources of early Vaishnava theology, in which Krishna is an avatar of the god Vishnu. Above all, the Mahabharata is an exposition of dharma (codes of conduct), including the proper conduct of a king, of a warrior, of an individual living in times of calamity, and of a person seeking to attain moksha (freedom from samsara, or rebirth). The poem repeatedly demonstrates that the conflicting codes of dharma are so “subtle” that, in some situations, the hero cannot help but violate them in some respect, no matter what choice he makes.The Mahabharata story has been retold in written and oral Sanskrit and vernacular versions throughout South and Southeast Asia. Its various incidents have been portrayed in stone, notably in sculptured reliefs at Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom in Cambodia, and in Indian miniature paintings.

            <h5><span data-scroll id="highlight">RAMAYAN</span></h5>
            <video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCeSDxINeNE">Story</video>
            <p>
                The Ramayana is known as the Adi Kavya (the earliest narrative poem). It contains 24,000 verses and is divided into seven books. The central theme of this epic is the con­flict between Rama, a representative of the Aryan civilization, and Ravana, a representative of the non-Aryan civilisation.

                The style is simple and direct and does not indulge the literary gymnastics so common among later classical writers. There are few episodes which are not connected with the main story. The text of Ramayana was not regarded as sacred as that of the Vedas and therefore different recessions of the book were formed.
                
                
                
                 
                According to the story of the Ramayana, King Dasaratha ruled over Kosala (northern Oudha) with Ayodhya as his capital. He had three wives, Kaushalya, the chief queen, Sumitra and Kaikayi. He had four sons—Rama, (the eldest son born of Kaushalya), Lakshmana and Shatrughana (born of Sumitra) and Bharat (son of the youngest queen Kaikayi).
                
                When Dashratha grew old, he wished Rama to succeed him to the throne, and therefore, appointed him Yuvraj.
                
                This was quite distasteful to Kaikayi, the youngest queen, who wanted her son Bharat to succeed Dashrath. Utilizing the two promises or vardans given by King Dashratha in the past, she demanded the exile of Rama for 14 years, and throne for her son Bharat.
                
                Rama as a dutiful son proceeded on exile with his wife and Lakshman, his brother who loved him most. Bharat, who also loved Rama very much, also refused to accept the throne and followed him in jungles. However, on persuasion of Rama he returned to Ayodhya and continued to rule in the name of Rama during the period of his exile.
                
                
                 
                During the course of exile while Rama was living in the forest at Panchavati near Nasik, Ravana’s sister visited them and asked Laxman to marry her. Laxman not only refused to marry her but also insulted her. Ravana, the demon king, took revenge for the insult of his sister by abducting Sita to Lanka (Ceylon).
                
                Rama and Laxman marched towards Lanka to rescue Sita. On the way Rama helped Sughriva to regain his lost kingdom from Bali. As a token of gratitude for this favour Sughriva offered the services of Hanuman, his able army general.
                
                Ultimately as a result of the great battle between Rama and Ravana at Lanka, Ravana was defeated and killed. Sita was brought back. In the meanwhile the term of fourteen years of exile was over and Rama returned to Ayodhya and became the king. He continued to rule for a long time.
                
                However, the troubles of Rama were not over and he was forced to send away Sita from his palace because her chastity was suspected by some of the subjects. Sita ultimately found shelter in the ashrama of Valmiki and gave birth to Lava and Kusha.
                
                
                
                 
                Rama discovered about the identity of these two sons only when he performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice and his horse was detained by these brave boys. These boys later on succeeded Rama.
