    <div class="mythology">
        <p class="about">Brahma (Sanskrit: ब्रह्मा, IAST: Brahmā) is the creator god in Hinduism. He is also known as Svayambhu (self-born), Vāgīśa (Lord of Speech), and the creator of the four Vedas, one from each of his mouths. Brahma is consort of Saraswati and he is the father (creator) of Four Kumaras, Narada, Daksha, Marichi and many more. Brahma is synonymous with the Vedic god Prajapati, he is also known as Vedanatha (god of Vedas), Gyaneshwara (god of Knowledge), Chaturmukha (having Four Faces) Svayambhu (self born), etc, as well as linked to Kama and Hiranyagarbha (the cosmic egg).</p>

        <p id="about">During the post vedic period (500 BCE to 500 CE), Brahma was a prominent deity, however he was slowly out shadowed by Vishnu, Shiva and Shakti. By the 7th century, Brahma was frequently attacked by Buddhist and Jain followers and lost his importance. Early texts suggest that Brahma created himself in a golden egg known as Hiranyagarbha. After he created himself, he then created the entire universe, Vedas and people. The avatars Matsya, Kurma and Varaha were first attributed to Prajapati (Brahma).

            Later Puranas describe him as emerging from a lotus, connected to the navel of Lord Vishnu. Other Puranas suggest that he is born from Shiva or his aspects, or he is a supreme god in diverse versions of Hindu philosophy. Brahma, along with other deities, is sometimes viewed as a form (saguna) of the otherwise formless (nirguna) Brahman, the ultimate metaphysical reality in Vedantic Hinduism. In an alternate version, some Puranas state him to be the father of Prajapatis.

   <br><br><br>
   <p>Swan Brahma, the god of creation, travels all over outer space on a swan, chanting the sacred Hindu scripture the Vedas. ... As per Hindu tradition, it's a bird which can figuratively sift the pure from the impure, like it sieves milk from water. Sometimes, Brahma is shown riding seven swans. Brahma, due to his elevated status, is less involved in picturesque myths where gods take on human form and character but is rather a generally abstract or metaphysical ideal of a great god. In later Puranas (Hindu epics) Brahma is no longer worshipped and other gods are assigned his myths, even if he always maintains his status as the creator god. Brahma's epithet is ekahamsa, the One Swan. His vahanam ('vehicle') is a peacock, swan or goose. He is still honoured today with an annual ceremony at the pilgrimage site of Pushkar in Rajasthan, India and he remains a popular figure in Southeast Asia, especially in Thailand and Bali.
