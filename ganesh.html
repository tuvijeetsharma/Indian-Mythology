 <br>
    <div class="mythology">
        <p class="about">Ganesha, also spelled Ganesh, also called Ganapati, elephant-headed Hindu god of beginnings, who is traditionally worshipped before any major enterprise and is the patron of intellectuals, bankers, scribes, and authors. ... Like a rat and like an elephant, Ganesha is a remover of obstacles.His name means both “Lord of the People” (gana means the common people) and “Lord of the Ganas” (Ganesha is the chief of the ganas, the goblin hosts of Shiva).</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p id="about">Ganesha or Ganesh, also known as Ganapati and Vinayaka, is one of the best-known and most worshipped deities in the Hindu pantheon. His image is found throughout India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Bali (Indonesia) and Bangladesh and in countries with large ethnic Indian populations including Fiji, Mauritius and Trinidad and Tobago. Hindu denominations worship him regardless of affiliations. Devotion to Ganesha is widely diffused and extends to Jains and Buddhists.

            Although Ganesha is known by many attributes, he is readily identified by his elephant head. Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits. Hindu mythology identifies him as the restored son of Parvati and Shiva of the Shaivism tradition, but he is a pan-Hindu god found in its various traditions. In the Ganapatya tradition of Hinduism, Ganesha is the supreme deity. The principal texts on Ganesha include the Ganesha Purana, the Mudgala Purana and the Ganapati Atharvashirsa. Brahma Purana and Brahmanda Purana are other two Puranic genre encyclopaedic texts that deal with Ganesha.</p>

   <h2><span data-scroll id="highlight">Lord Ganesha's Ride (Savari)</span></h2>
   <br><br><br>
   <p>According to Ganesha Purana, there was a celestial musician-god named Krauncha. He accidentally stepped on the foot of Muni Vamadeva who cursed him to become a mouse. ... The prophecy was fulfilled when the mouse became the vahana of Ganesha.  Ganesha's mouse
    The mouse with many stories
    
    There are many stories behind why Ganesha rides on a mouse. According to one interesting tale, a musician god, Krauncha, was cursed into becoming a mouse. But he was the size of a mountain and destroyed everything in his way. When he reached the ashram where Ganesha was staying, he was captured. He begged for forgiveness and became Ganesha's vehicle.
    Once, when Lord Ganesha was invited to Maharishi Parashar’s ashrama. Krauncha ended up stepping on the ashram and destroyed it. Lord Ganesha decided to meet the giant mouse and teach him a lesson. He unleashed one of his weapons called ‘pasha’ which ended up looping around Krauncha’s neck and brought him to Ganesha’s feet. Kroncha asked for forgiveness and asked Ganesha to accept him as his vehicle. However, Krauncha couldn’t bear the weight of Lord Ganesha and he requested him to become light-weight which is bearable. Since then the mouse is the vehicle of Lord Ganesha.
